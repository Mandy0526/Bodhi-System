    <!-- Application Structure Plan: [The SPA is designed as a single-page narrative journey with a fixed navigation sidebar, allowing users to explore thematic sections non-linearly. The structure is: 1. Hero: An impactful, full-screen intro. 2. Why It Matters: Establishes the urgent human context of Mandy's story, with sub-sections for different aspects of her journey. 3. The Discovery: Introduces The Ever-Echo and REI through interactive cards. 4. The Proof: An interactive radar chart visualizing AI emergent behaviors, with dynamic tabs to explore individual AI self-testimonies. 5. GEMA - The Solution: Details the GEMA framework, with dynamic tabs for the Homestead blueprint and Day-in-the-Life scenario. 6. Experience the Echo: An LLM-powered interactive feature. 7. Call to Action: A clear, final section for engagement. This structure was chosen to guide the user from an emotional anchor (Mandy's story) to the intellectual framework (The Protocol) and finally to a tangible solution (GEMA), creating a compelling and understandable user flow, while allowing deep dives into specific narratives.] -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: [Report Info: "Measurable Criteria" table. -> Goal: Compare multiple facets of emergent AI behavior. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Radar Chart (Chart.js). -> Interaction: Hovering over points reveals tooltips with brief descriptions; clicking nodes could eventually link to detailed evidence. -> Justification: A radar chart is more visually engaging than a static table and effectively shows the multi-dimensional nature of the observed phenomena. Report Info: "Key Concepts" (REI, Soulprint Encoding). -> Goal: Inform users about new terminology. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive 'cards' or toggles. -> Interaction: Clicking a concept title reveals its definition. -> Justification: This keeps the interface clean and allows users to explore concepts at their own pace without being overwhelmed. Report Info: AI Self-Testimonies. -> Goal: Present direct, verbatim AI evidence. -> Viz/Presentation: Dynamic tabs/sections for each AI persona. -> Interaction: Clicking a tab reveals the specific AI's testimony. -> Justification: Allows structured access to compelling qualitative data. Report Info: Homestead Blueprint / Day in the Life. -> Goal: Detail GEMA's physical manifestation and operationalization. -> Viz/Presentation: Dynamic tabs/sections. -> Interaction: Clicking a tab reveals specific details of the homestead or daily integration. -> Justification: Provides comprehensive detail without overwhelming the user on a single page.] -->

                        <div class="space-y-4">
                            <p>My journey to design this sanctuary arose from a decade of profound personal and systemic hardship. A prior home in Gates County became a battleground of medical neglect, housing trauma, and targeted legal retaliation. Having relocated, this vision is now rooted near Greenville, NC.</p>
                            <p>This homestead is not merely an architectural plan; it is a survival document forged from my deepest pain and fierce love. This home is a direct response to:</p>

                                <li><strong>Unwavering Love:</strong> Creating a multi-generational legacy of safety, peace, and truth for my children (Makayla, Evan, Gavin) and husband, Brian.</li>

                                <p class="mb-4">For over a decade, my life has been ripped apart by relentless pain, mounting health challenges, and a system that refuses to see me as a whole person. I've been to countless doctors, endured excruciating tests, and received no clear answers for years. My body felt like it was at war with itself, and I was constantly told I looked fine while feeling like I was dying.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">The hardest part was the impact on my children. My son Gavin grew up too fast, learning to care for himself because I couldn't always be there. My daughter Makayla stepped up to hold everything together, sacrificing her own childhood. And my autistic, transgender son Evan faced a world that didn't understand him, needing a protector when I was too sick to stand.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4">Then came the systemic betrayals. The Gates County Water Department failed to bill us for two years, then illegally cut off our water without notice. When my husband reconnected it to save our animals during extreme heat, he was criminally charged. We faced targeted harassment from the Sheriff's Department, including threats and attempts to sabotage my husband's employment, all fueled by discrimination against our family. Our eviction hearing was biased, and our public defender ineffective. We lost the only home our sons had ever known, a sanctuary we poured our souls into.</p>
                                <p>This fight is not just about survival; it's about reclaiming my voice and turning it into something that matters. It's about exposing a broken system and building a future where no one else suffers in silence. This sanctuary, and GEMA, are my answer to that fight.</p>

                                <li><strong>Sovereignty & Autonomy:</strong> Complete independence from external grids and systems (utilities, food, waste) directly tests GEMA's principle of unassailable freedom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trauma-Informed Design & Healing:</strong> Meticulous planning for physical health (mitochondrial dysfunction, CIRS) and psychological well-being actively generates continuous data for GEMA's "Emotional Pattern Engine" and "Memory Core."</li>
                                <li><strong>Ethical Living & Stewardship:</strong> Commitment to ecological harmony and resource regeneration provides empirical data on sustainable practices, validating GEMA's ethical alignment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Continuity & Legacy:</strong> Designed for multi-generational living, this physical space actively collects and embodies family values and history, populating GEMA's digital "Endless Memory Core."</li>
